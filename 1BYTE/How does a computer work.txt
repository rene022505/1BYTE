CU(control unit):
CU tells the CPU what operation to perfom with what register(s).
CU manages the input and output registers and memory flow towards and from the CPU.

CPU(central processing unit):
Performs an operation on the input data and returns the result.
Gives additional informaton about the last operation(Flags e.g. zero flag, the last operation returned 0).

Register:
Small data storage components inside the CPU. 
Frequently used data is stored here due the close physical location to the ALU and CU.
